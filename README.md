# watchOS Counter

watchOS counter application created during Intuit iOS Workshop hosted at Northeastern University on 10/24/2018. Allows the user to increment a count displayed on the watch by one as many times as desired. Also allows the user to record the current number on the watchOS display to a table on the corresponding iPhone device and to reset the count to zero.
